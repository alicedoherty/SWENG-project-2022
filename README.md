Propylon - Blockchain publishing system

## Description

Build a web-based application for authoring and publishing content, with published versions being persisted 
on the blockchain for auditability and verification. Users of the system should be able to see the current 
version of a piece of content (e.g. a blog post), validate it’s authenticity by comparing to a version stored
in the blockchain, and also view previous versions published to the blockchain. The blockchain should provide 
a verifiable audit trail for all versions of a piece of content, so consumers can be sure it hasn’t been 
tampered with or modified externally.
