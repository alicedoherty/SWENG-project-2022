\subsection{Scope}

The following items are in scope for this project:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Allow users to publish content, with versions being stored on the blockchain.
	\item The system must be able to validate the authenticity of information that is on the blockchain.
	\item The system must prevent tampering of information.
	\item The system must allow users to visually see the following:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Authenticity of information.
		\item Previous history versions of that information, as well as who contributed to those versions.
		\item If information has been tampered with.
	\end{itemize}
	\item The system can support a pre-existing blockchain or a new one.
	\item The system can be built on pre-existing open source CMS such as WordPress or a personal website. 
	\item The system allows for documents to be viewed publically.
\end{itemize}
The following items are out of scope for this project:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The system does not need to support mobile devices, desktop is sufficient.
	\item The system does not need to support multiple information methods of showing something to a user,
		  a blog will suffice.
	\item The system focuses on the blockchain aspect and so, a website that allows users to login and register
		  and creating passwords and login, is out of the scope. A simple login that demonstrates the blockchain 
		  capability is sufficient.
\end{itemize}
