\subsection{Overview}

A web-based application for authoring and publishing content (e.g a blog) onto a 
blockchain with current and past versions of the content persisting on the blockchain. 
\\ \\The application should: 
\begin{itemize}
    \item Allow users of the system to see the current version of the content.
    \item Validate the authenticity of the content by comparing it to a version stored on the blockchain.
    \item View previous versions of content published to the blockchain.
    \item Provide a verifiable audit trail of the blockchain for all versions of 
		  content to prove that content hasnâ€™t been tampered with, 
          changed, or otherwise modified externally
\end{itemize}
