\subsection{Overview and Success Criteria}

Validation of information on the internet has gotten harder and harder with time.
The internet is filled with misinformation, untrustworthy history and suspicious 
sources. The need for a way of validating information found on the internet in a 
way that is trustworthy has become ever so important in our day and age.\\

This is where Blockchain comes in, it will provide an effective way of validating
history, current information and prevent tampering with information on the internet.\\

The Blockchain will work with solving these problems and the website itself will
give a user friendly experience to the user, showing them visually, previous versions
of information they seek as well as giving a visual indicator of validity and that
tampering for certain did not occur, so that the user can be certain of its validity.
