\section{Current System}
Our client, Propylon, does not currently use blockchain technology in their current system.
However, they do use specialised software which acts almost like a blockchain. 
There are currently many blockchains already in existence which would be suited to our project 
such as the Ethereum blockchain and the Polygon blockchain. \\

\noindent
Using an existing blockchain such as the Polygon blockchain has many benefits. These include: 

\begin{itemize}
    \item Security and reliability.
    \item Relatively cheap transaction fees.
    \item Established documentation for developers.
    \item Developers can work on their test net for free.
\end{itemize}

\noindent
Alternatively, our team could make our own blockchain. 
However, this would require much more effort as secure blockchains 
are often difficult to develop and also cost resources to maintain.
