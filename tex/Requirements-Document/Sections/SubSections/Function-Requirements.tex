\subsection{Functional Requirements}
The main requirement for this project is to create a program that allows the user to publish documents 
to a blockchain to be validated.
\\ \\Using a blockchain, our program should be able to:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Show the audit trail of the document, i.e. show the history of changes made, and the individuals who made them.
    \item Store all previous versions of the document, so users can view past versions that have been uploaded.
    \item Check and validate the document, i.e. check whether the stated authors and editors actually wrote 
		  the content theyâ€™re credited for.
    \item Display these documents publicly. For example, legal legislations and regulations proposed by the government.
\end{itemize}
